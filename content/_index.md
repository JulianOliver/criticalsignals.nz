## Practising critical responses to disrupted futures.

---

Critical Signals invites you into a three-month public space for learning, imagining, and practising how sovereignty, resilience and collective care will shape our futures in times of rapid change.

---

Opening 18 July at 115 Taranaki Street, Critical Signals invites the public into
a living research space for three months of workshops, installations, and
conversations exploring the critical systems we rely on — from food to data,
water to power — and how we build, own, and nurture them together.

Critical Signals explores practical and visionary responses to an era of
collapses, with a focus on kai sovereignty, data sovereignty, collective
resilience, and adaptation strategies under a rapidly changing climate. With
community at the project center, it asks what changes could we make to our
infrastructure, food and energy systems to ensure we not just survive, but
thrive, in the years ahead.

Part artist lab, part civil defence rethink, part neighbourhood commons —
Critical Signals offers a space to gather, experiment, and prepare. Open daily
and free to all, it asks not just how we survive disruption, but how we create
infrastructures for living — with care, agency, and creativity.
