Anna Brown is Professor of Design at Toi Āria Design for Public Good, and is a
research co-lead of the project Ngā Ngaru Wakapuke; a climate and disaster
research project. She will discuss her work with several communities in
Tairāwhiti, Wairarapa and Ōtautahi/Christchurch on mapping for disaster
scenarios. She describes maps as more than locational tools; as a way to build
a common understanding of shared assets. Anna will lead us through an exercise
to record Wellington CBD’s community points of interest, that will be added to
over the course of Critical Signals.
