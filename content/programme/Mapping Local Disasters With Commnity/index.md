Get hands-on with air-dry clay as we reimagine Wellington’s CBD at scale. In this collaborative workshop, we’ll explore how we think about natural hazard risk and resilience—through shape, texture, and place.
By treating the city as a model we can mould, you’ll gain new insights into scale, design, and the ways we interpret our shared environment. No experience is needed—just bring your curiosity, your observational eye, and a willingness to work with others.
The clay city model of the Wellington CBD you help create will be a central reference point throughout the Critical Signals series.
Mairéad de Róiste is an Associate Professor at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington and is a mapping expert whose work spans geovisualisation, spatial thinking, and the effective communication of geographic data.
